>This Arduino code allows an LED connected to pin 13 of the Arduino to be controlled via Bluetooth. It initializes the necessary components in the setup function by setting pin 13 as an output and starting serial communication at a baud rate of 9600, which is compatible with most Bluetooth modules. A welcome message is sent to indicate the system is ready to receive commands.

In the loop function, the code continuously checks if there is incoming data from the serial buffer. When data is available, it reads the incoming characters and constructs a string. This string is then cleaned of any leading or trailing whitespace to ensure accurate command recognition.

The code processes various commands:

"ON" turns the LED on and sends a confirmation message back.
"OFF" turns the LED off and sends a confirmation message.
"STATUS" checks the current state of the LED and sends back whether it is on or off.
"BRIGHTNESS <value>" adjusts the LED brightness to a specified value between 0 and 255 using PWM (Pulse Width Modulation).
If an unknown command is received, the code responds with an error message and lists the valid commands. This ensures clear communication and control over the LED via Bluetooth.

>Hardware Connections
LED Connection:

Connect the anode (longer leg) of the LED to digital pin 13 on the Arduino.
Connect the cathode (shorter leg) of the LED to one end of a current-limiting resistor (220 ohms to 1k ohms).
Connect the other end of the resistor to the GND pin on the Arduino.
Bluetooth Module Connection:

Connect the VCC pin of the Bluetooth module to the 5V pin on the Arduino.
Connect the GND pin of the Bluetooth module to the GND pin on the Arduino.
Connect the TXD (transmit) pin of the Bluetooth module to the RX (pin 0) on the Arduino.
Connect the RXD (receive) pin of the Bluetooth module to the TX (pin 1) on the Arduino. If the Bluetooth module operates at 3.3V, use a voltage divider to step down the 5V signal from the Arduino.
Using a Bluetooth Terminal App
Pairing:

Power on the Arduino and Bluetooth module.
Open Bluetooth settings on your smartphone, tablet, or computer.
Search for and pair with the Bluetooth module (usually named HC-05 or HC-06) using the default PIN (1234 or 0000).
Connecting:

Open a Bluetooth terminal app on your device.
Connect to the paired Bluetooth module.
Sending Commands:

Use the app to send commands like ON, OFF, STATUS, and BRIGHTNESS <value> to control the LED.
This setup allows wireless control of the LED using Bluetooth communication, providing a convenient way to interact with the Arduino board.ch
